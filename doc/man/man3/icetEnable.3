.SH Description

.PP
The \fBicetEnable\fPand \fBicetDisable\fPfunctions turn various \fBIceT \fPfeatures on 
and off. \fIpname\fP
is a symbolic constant representing the feature to 
be turned on or off. Valid values for \fIpname\fP
are: 
.PP
.TP
\fBICET_CORRECT_COLORED_BACKGROUND\fP
 Colored backgrounds are 
problematic when performing color blended compositing in that the 
background color will be additively blended from each image. Enabling 
this flag will internally cause the color to be reset to black and then 
cause the color to be blended back into the resulting images. This 
flag is disabled by default. 
.TP
\fBICET_DISPLAY\fP
 If enabled, the final, composited image for 
each tile is written back to the frame buffer before the return of 
\fBicetDrawFrame\fP\&.
This flag is enabled by default. 
.TP
\fBICET_DISPLAY_COLORED_BACKGROUND\fP
 If this and 
\fBICET_DISPLAY\fP
are enabled, uses \fbOpenGL \fPblending to ensure that 
all background is set to the correct color. This flag is disabled by 
default. This option does not affect the images returned from 
\fBicetGetColorBuffer\fPor \fBicetGetDepthBuffer\fP;it only affects the image 
in the \fbOpenGL \fPcolor buffer. 
.TP
\fBICET_DISPLAY_INFLATE\fP
 If this and \fBICET_DISPLAY\fP
are enabled and the renderable window is larger then the displayed tile 
(as determined by the current \fbOpenGL \fPviewport), then resample the 
image to fit within the renderable window before writing back to frame 
buffer. This flag is disabled by default. This option does not affect 
the images returned from \fBicetGetColorBuffer\fPor \fBicetGetDepthBuffer\fP;it 
only affects the image in the OpenGL color buffer. 
.TP
\fBICET_DISPLAY_INFLATE_WITH_HARDWARE\fP
 This option 
determines how images are inflated. When enabled (the default), images 
are inflated by creating a texture and allowing the hardware the 
inflate the image. When disabled, images are inflated on the CPU. 
This option has no effect unless both \fBICET_DISPLAY\fP
and 
\fBICET_DISPLAY_INFLATE\fP
are also enabled. 
.TP
\fBICET_FLOATING_VIEWPORT\fP
 If enabled, the projection will 
be shifted such that the geometry will be rendered in one shot whenever 
possible, even if the geometry straddles up to four tiles. This flag 
is enabled by default. 
.TP
\fBICET_ORDERED_COMPOSITE\fP
 If enabled, the image composition 
will be performed in the order specified by the last call to 
\fBicetCompositeOrder\fP,
assuming the current strategy (specified by 
a call to \fBicetStrategy\fP)
supports ordered composition. 
Generally, you want to enable ordered compositing if doing color 
blending and disable if you are doing z\-buffer comparisons. If 
enabled, you should call \fBicetCompositeOrder\fP
between each frame 
to update the image order as camera angles change. This flag is 
disabled by default.

.SH Errors

.PP
.TP
\fBICET_INVALID_VALUE\fP
 If \fIpname\fP
is not a feature 
to be enabled or disabled. 
.PP
.SH Warnings

.PP
None. 
.PP
.SH Bugs

.PP
The check for a valid \fIpname\fP
is not thorough, and thus the 
\fBICET_INVALID_VALUE\fP
error may not always be raised.
