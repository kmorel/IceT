.SH Description

.PP
The main \fBIceT \fPalgorithms are specially designed to composite data 
defined on multiple tiles. Some of these algorithms, namely 
\fBICET_STRATEGY_REDUCE\fP
and \fBICET_STRATEGY_SEQUENTIAL\fP,
operate at least in part by compositing single images together. \fBIceT \fP
also comes with multiple separate strategies for performing this single 
image compositing, and this can be selected with the 
\fBicetSingleImageStrategy\fP
function. 
.PP
A single image strategy is chosen from one of the following provided 
enumerated values: 
.PP
.TP
\fBICET_SINGLE_IMAGE_STRATEGY_AUTOMATIC\fP
 Automatically 
chooses which single image strategy to use based on the number of 
processes participating in the composition. 
.igsingle image strategy!automatic
.TP
\fBICET_SINGLE_IMAGE_STRATEGY_BSWAP\fP
 The classic binary swap 
compositing algorithm. At each phase of the algorithm, each process 
partners with another, sends half of its image to its partner, and 
receives the opposite half from its partner. The processes are then 
partitioned into two groups that each have the same image part, and the 
algorithm recurses. 
.igsingle image strategy!binary swap
.TP
\fBICET_SINGLE_IMAGE_STRATEGY_TREE\fP
 At each phase, each 
process partners with another, and one of the processes sends its entire 
image to the other. The algorithm recurses with the group of processes 
that received images until only one process has an image. 
.igsingle image strategy!tree
.PP
By default \fBIceT \fPsets the single image strategy to 
\fBICET_SINGLE_IMAGE_STRATEGY_AUTOMATIC\fP
when a context is 
created. This is the single image strategy that will be used if no other 
is selected.
